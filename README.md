Project Title: Amazon Reviews Project - Deep Learning and Data Analysis
Author: Haroun Grine


Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from Amazon to extract insights, perform data quality checks, and implement predictive models using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The main goals of the project include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the review dataset for analysis.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
- Building and evaluating models for sentiment analysis and review scoring.
- Applying deep learning techniques to handle large-scale text data and improve prediction accuracy.

Key Features:
1. **Data Quality**: Initial checks and data cleaning to ensure the dataset is accurate and complete.
2. **Exploration**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data's structure and distribution.
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Sentiment Analysis: Using machine learning to classify review sentiments as positive or negative.
   - Review Scoring: Predicting review scores based on text analysis.
4. **Deep Learning**: Utilizing advanced methods like LSTMs or transformers for text data processing and sentiment prediction.

Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages**: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
- **Machine Learning Tools**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive graphs.
- **Deployment (Optional)**: Demonstration of model deployment using Flask or FastAPI.

Use Case:
The analysis and models built in this project can be extended to e-commerce platforms to:
- Improve customer experience by filtering out poor-quality reviews.
- Identify product trends and address customer concerns.
- Automate the sentiment analysis process for large-scale review datasets.
